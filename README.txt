---------- goal ----------

Add CSS and JS to the included HTML file to fulfill the mocks and specs. Other than the contents of the STYLE and SCRIPT tags, DO NOT MODIFY THE HTML AT ALL.

---------- specs ----------

---------- bonus ----------

These features are not required, but would be fantastic to include:

- Animate showing and hiding the list of ingredients. Design details are up to you.

- If a list is already sorted, clicking the same button should REVERSE the order.
  For example, clicking "Sort by Calories" should start with Paneer Masala Dosa and end with Baked Macaroni and Cheese. If the list is already in this order, then clicking "Sort by Calories" again would start with Baked Macaroni and Cheese and end with Paneer Masala Dosa.

---------- note ----------

Yummly's data changes over time, so as long as you build the URLs the correct way, don't be concerned if a recipe page or ingredient search page appear broken on the Yummly side. You're only responsible for your page, not ours!

Please let me know if anything is unclear, or if you get stuck on any step. Though some of these requirements may be difficult to accomplish with the given HTML, there's nothing that's actually intended to trick you.

Thanks,
HB
