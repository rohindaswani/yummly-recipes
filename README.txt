---------- goal ----------

Add CSS and JS to the included HTML file to fulfill the mocks and specs. Other than the contents of the STYLE and SCRIPT tags, DO NOT MODIFY THE HTML AT ALL.

---------- note ----------

Yummly's data changes over time, so as long as you build the URLs the correct way, don't be concerned if a recipe page or ingredient search page appear broken on the Yummly side. You're only responsible for your page, not ours!

Please let me know if anything is unclear, or if you get stuck on any step. Though some of these requirements may be difficult to accomplish with the given HTML, there's nothing that's actually intended to trick you.

Thanks,
HB
